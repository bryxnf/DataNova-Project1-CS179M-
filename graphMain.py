'''
Goal is to copy the entire main file
then run the program where you have a count time which calculates the time
and then when the user presses the ENTER button save that time total
also keep that distance array stored not THE BEST DISTANCE so we can show
the iterations of how the distance falls as more iterations happen
next once the first ENTER BUTTON is pressed we basically run the OTHER ALGORITHM
aka the Nearest Neighbour algorithm without the (RANDOMIZATION) here and run it until
that count time ends so we have an even time difference shown how both algorithms work
and once that timer ends we take the distance array of both one called distanceNN distanceNNRand
and basically send this to graph.py which will create the visualization and return it

NOTE:
distanceNN is a 2D array where it stores [[distance,iteration], [[550,42]]] or
distanceNN is a 3D array where it stores [[distance,iteration,time], [550,42,0:13:15]] something like that
